#Know the Killer - Know Yourself
Welcome to the app to make it so you can finally have an edge against killers as a survivor!

* `character_portrait_path to point` to your steam install location with `DeadByDaylight\Content\UI\Icons\CharPortraits` appended to the end
* `output_file` to wherever you want to store output information for the session
